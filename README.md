This program includes code from a game project I made called Quiet Reflection
It features an audio player that allows for players to: 
- See the current song's name
- How far the song is into the track
- Skip the current song and play a new random song
- Mute the current song
- Control the volume of the current song

The game also features a jukebox, which displays songs that the player can 
manually select and play at any time.
